# Cave_Game
A simple 'cave' simulation loosely based on the 'terrarium' exercise featured in Eloquent Javascript. This game runs in a web browser and makes use of Angular JS. - Open 'Cave.html' in a browser to play.

(Note:'Lichens', 'Crickets', and 'Beetles' must initially be placed next to rocks.)
